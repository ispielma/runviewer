"""The save panel behind *Save channel config*.

A save panel decides the extension of the file it returns. Given a name that
already has one it keeps that one, and typing replaces only the stem. Given a
bare folder it has no extension to preserve and supplies one of its own, taken
from the host's type database rather than from the name filter the dialog asked
for -- so the file that comes back need not be a ``.toml`` file at all, and
nothing between the panel and ``save_appconfig`` would notice.

What is pinned here is that the handler hands the panel a filename carrying the
extension a channel configuration is meant to have, in the folder those
configurations live in, and that the name offered is not the runviewer state
file -- which sits in that same folder, holds something else entirely, and is
the one file an operator must not be invited to overwrite from this dialog.

Pinned alongside it is what becomes of the name the panel returns, whatever the
panel or the operator made of it: the file written is a ``.toml`` file, and a
name already ending in an app config extension has that extension replaced
rather than added to. Those two rules are ``appconfig_path_with_suffix``, and
they are pinned here because the extension a dialog offers and the extension its
file ends up with are one contract, not two.

The panel belongs to the operating system and cannot be driven from a test, so
the seam under test is the call into it: ``QFileDialog`` is replaced in the
application's namespace and the arguments it was given are read back. What the
file is called is read from the directory afterwards, the name being the whole
of what is under test.
